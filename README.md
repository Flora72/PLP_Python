  - Division (`/`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
- Uses function mapping via a dictionary for clean and scalable logic
- Handles invalid operator inputs gracefully

### Assignment Objective 
1. Practice creating Python programs to perform arithmetic and string. 
2. Experimenting with variables. 
3. Exploring data types.

### How to Run

### Using windows
python index.py

### Using macos
python3 index.py

```bash
Enter your first number: 12
Enter a mathematical operator(-, +, *, /, %): *
